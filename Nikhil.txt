As I checked, the Application pool of the domain was stuck due to multiple connections hitting, so the resources allocated for your application pool are reaching their limit and causing the application pool to get stuck.
We have to restart the application in such a case to continue the normal working of your domain.
The website is working fine now; please check.

You need to clean the site by removing the infected files.

You can scan the files which you have uploaded in the file manager on your PC and then reupload the scanned files. Check for any malicious files, and codes and remove them with the help of your developer if you are not sure which codes are malicious. Once everything is cleaned you can reupload the files and submit a request to Google. They will check and if everything is fine they will approve the site and your site will be visible to all again.

Please refer to the article which provides all steps in detail:
https://www.milesweb.in/hosting-faqs/remove-deceptive-site-ahead-warning/

Once you have scanned the files and removed all malicious codes and files, submit your request to Google webmaster tools for verification.
Here is the article for reference: https://www.milesweb.in/hosting-faqs/submit-your-website-url-to-google/

Mod Security for your domains on the server is a security package that provides better protection for your domains.
When you make modifications to the domain, your IP address is triggered in the mod security wall, causing an issue.
To fix this, temporarily disable the mod security and then re-enable it once the changes are complete.
https://prnt.sc/ScBc199_Jn6T
Please enable Mod protection once the changes have been completed, as it is an additional protection for your domain that protects you from attacks.
